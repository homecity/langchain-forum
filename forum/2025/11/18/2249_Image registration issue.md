**Why does my console log show that I registered two graphs, but Studio only displays one and I can’t switch between them?**

[/u/ljojo5663-web](@ljojo5663-web) Can you elaborate on what you mean by console log showing you registered two graphs?

If this is your local dev server, can you also try restarting your sever?
