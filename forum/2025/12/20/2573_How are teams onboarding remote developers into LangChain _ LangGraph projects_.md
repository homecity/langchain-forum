We are scaling an agentic app built with LangChain and LangGraph and bringing in remote engineers via a remote recruitment agency (e.g., Crewbloom). Curious how others handle onboarding, repo access, prompt/version control, and Lang Smith observability when contributors are fully remote. Any best practices?
