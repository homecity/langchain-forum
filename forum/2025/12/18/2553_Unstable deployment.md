We encountered problems with our langsmith deployment today twice. As you see on the screenshot, tasks was queuing up, and workers didn’t pick them up. This causes a lot of issues in our application, because we expect quick replies in some areas of our application.

We did monitor server status at langsmith but didnt see any problems. Could you confirm that this was a problem on your side?
