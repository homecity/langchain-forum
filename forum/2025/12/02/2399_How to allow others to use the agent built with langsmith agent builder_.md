Just saw the agent builder. It is great tool.

One quick question: how do I expose the agent i built in the builder to other users? is there an API endpoint that i could deploy the agent built to other web sites? or do i have to invite all users to come to the agent builder to use it?

thanks.

hey there, there is a button on the agent editor page to call that agent using your LangSmith api key. If you click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the editor page, that opens a settings modal and you can then click “View code snippets”
