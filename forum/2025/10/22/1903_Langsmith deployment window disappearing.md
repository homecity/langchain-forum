Today I deleted our langsmith cloud deployment intending to recreate it. Every time I tab away from the browser, the deployment window closes and just shows the “new deployment” window. This is an issue because I’m trying to copy and paste some configs in the deployment window. This just started happening today although it’s been a while since I made a new deployment and it’s happening in both firefox and chrome. Very frustrating.
