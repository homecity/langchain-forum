**Question:**

Is there a way to re-score runs by just updating the reference outputs, without re-executing the entire evaluation?

**Context / Purpose:**

I’d like to avoid generating new traces every time I adjust the reference outputs. The goal is to simply re-score against the new references and save on trace usage.
