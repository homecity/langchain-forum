I’m running experiments using a reference dataset where we compute similarity scores. However, the scores are not being reported in the experiment dashboard, even though I can see in the tracing project evaluators that the scores are successfully generated.

Do you know why the scores might not be showing up in the final output or how I can make sure they’re included?

Hi [/u/sima](@Sima) Are you able to share your workspace ID? Additionally, is this in EU prod or prod saas?

Additionally, can you share how you are running these evals? A minimally reproducible example will help the team investigate the issue you reported
