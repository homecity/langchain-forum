We have several runs where `ls_mode`l is set correctly and we’ve defined a custom pricing entry in LangSmith (value cost record). However, cost still doesn’t show up in the run details or analytics.

Are there extra steps required to enable cost tracking for custom-priced models? I verified the regex to work on [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/) so it’s not the regex.

What else could this be?
