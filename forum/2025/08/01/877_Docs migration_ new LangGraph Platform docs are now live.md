Big Docs Update Incoming!

Hi everyone! We’re excited to share that we’re migrating our product documentation to a new home: [http://docs.langchain.com](docs.langchain.com). This new site is designed to make it easier to explore and navigate the LangChain ecosystem based on what you’re trying to build.

 What’s new?

The [https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform](LangGraph Platform docs are already live) — complete with streamlined navigation and improved organization by task.

 What’s next?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be moving the LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith docs into this unified experience. You’ll be able to switch between products using the new dropdown in the top nav.

 Stay tuned!

We’ll post in the Forum when the next set of docs are updated. In the meantime, if you have feedback, please feel free to post here.
