Hi there,

I am a backend dev, recently reorg’d to get things moving in an AI org within my workplace. I am trying to migrate a project initially using OpenAI SDK (from langchain ai), for generation to `Deep Research Agent` due to our now involved process requiring complex the need of LangGraph, for now we are looking at this package: [https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research](GitHub - langchain-ai/open_deep_research)

Right now, I want to move to open_deep_research, but can’t seem to integrate it to my backend.  I have read through various guides, spinned up the local version according to the documentation but that is it. I wanted to be able to integrate this package in my backend. Reading through the source code, I can’t seem to wrap my head on how to integrate this, it differs from langchain guides and resources, which provide certain APIs i can call such as the `.invoke()` and many more.

How best should I approach this?

Thank you very much for your support.
