Hi, my application runs `ChatVertexAI` from langchain_google_vertexai. It’s not totally clear to me whether I should have to migrate anything after the [https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/deprecations/genai-vertexai-sdk](deprecation from Google of vertexai.generative_models).

Is the library being updated to cope with deprecation in a manner that is transparent for users? Or should I migrate to other library?

This should be a fairly common case for many users, but surprisingly I could not find a clear answer to this issue. Thank you very much.
