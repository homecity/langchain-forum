**Big Docs Update Incoming!**

Hi everyone! We’re excited to share that we’re migrating our product documentation to a new home: [http://docs.langchain.com](docs.langchain.com). This new site is designed to make it easier to explore and navigate the LangChain ecosystem based on what you’re trying to build.

 **What’s new?**

**The [https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/home](LangSmith docs) are now live** — with streamlined navigation and improved organization by task.

Plus, the [https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform](LangGraph Platform docs) are already available on the site!

 What’s next?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be moving the LangChain and LangGraph docs into this unified experience. You’ll be able to switch between products using the new dropdown in the top nav.

 Stay tuned!

We’ll post in the Forum when the next set of docs are updated. In the meantime, if you have feedback, please feel free to share it here.

The new doc site is looking awesome so far!

I had actually made some edits to the navigation UI for the TypeDocs generated content in the older [https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/index.html](https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/index.html) and wanted to do a pull request… but um… am I late for that party? This Mintlify site looks like where the party’s migrating to. I’m still getting acclimated to LangChainJS but wanted to contribute early through some some front-end dev and design work for the docs but there’s just so many repos to keep track of.

Is my attention best spent on the Mintlify site or is there still a need and use for the other/older ones? Should I still do my PR for it? If there are plans for getting all those generated TypeDocs into Mintlify, I’d like to help with that in some way.

Hi Rito, Thanks so much!

While the product docs have moved to the new Mintlify site, the API docs are not moving for some time, so we’d really appreciate your contribution!

Let me know if you have any other questions,

Kathryn

Cool.  Had PR approved to improve the header, feels good to now be a contributor!

Also, I had noticed the Mintlify site had a chatbot UI. I tried to make some edits locally to it but I couldn’t find the actual code for it anywhere in the repo (it was weird). A little while later I saw a different UI implementation of it on the live site, but now the chatbot has been removed altogether.

If that’s something that’s desirable to have integrated again at some point, I could help get that set up smoothly (as long as I can find the code!). Feel free to ping me and let me know.
