In the previous version of the platform, I was able to easily move an evaluator from one tracing project to another directly in the UI. There used to be a list of all evaluators, and I could simply edit the associated tracing project for any of them.

With the recent updates, it seems that this feature no longer exists. I haven’t found any way to change the tracing project linked to an evaluator now.

If anyone knows how to do this in the new version, I’d really appreciate your help. It would save me a lot of time.
