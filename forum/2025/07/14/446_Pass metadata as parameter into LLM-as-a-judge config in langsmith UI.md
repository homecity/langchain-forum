Hi there!

I have a question. Is it possible to pass metadata into LLM-as-a-judge evaluator?

This is about online and over-a-dataset evaluators.

I know it is possible with SDK, but is there any way to do it in langsmith UI?

Thanks!

No –  currently you can only pull from example inputs and reference outputs when using LLM-as-a-judge evaluators in the LangSmith UI.
