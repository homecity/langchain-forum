Hi,

A deployment that has a very recent revision (15 minutes ago) doesn’t have the “Monitoring” tab visible. It’s our production environment so I’m extremely interested in looking at the monitoring 

The deployment id is `c9c3bf9c-79b4-45f6-aa10-f33850f2cde2`, it’s a production deployment.

The `Monitoring` tab doesn’t exist:

Any idea what that’s the case?

Hi [/u/lukanarrative](@lukanarrative) , there are some older deployments that monitoring has not been rolled out to yet. You should see the monitoring tab appear by the end of the month
