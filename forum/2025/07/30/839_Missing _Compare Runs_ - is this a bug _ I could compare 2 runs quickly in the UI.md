I am unable to quickly compare 2 runs, there was a button in a previous version to compare 2 runs

If you click a run, there is a compare button on the top right to select another one to compare side by side. Docs: [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/compare_traces](Compare traces | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith)

Found it, I have to click into a trace and then hit “Compare” vs “Compare” directly being on the dashboard for that shows all the traces.

Can see how that’s confusing. We can add it to the trace table
