I can’t find anywhere in UI where I can simple update or delete feedback tags

Hi [/u/sicktastic](@sicktastic),

This is not currently supported at the moment. We’ve heard this is a common feature requests and are looking at adding it in a future release.

Best,

Chad

Is there a way for you (on your end) to remove all the tags we already have?  Not being able to do anything is really problematic as we try to set up the AQ for our team.  Our engineer created some test tags not knowing that it can’t be edited or deleted.

I just want to surface this as a feature that will be helpful for cleaning out workspaces and making it easier to manage our evaluators, annotations queues, and runs.  I can see maybe why it would be tricky because that feedback tag is associated with a run directly.  But if I’m deleting it I would like to remove it from all runs simply because either I don’t believe the tag is accurate, valuable or helpful.  In some cases I may have set it up incorrectly and/or I have a lot of similar named tags that mean the same thing.
