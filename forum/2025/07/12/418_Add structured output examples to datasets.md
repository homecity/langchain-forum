Hi there!

I’m running into a rather specific issue: I want to build a dataset with reference input/output pairs from the runs of a node that calls OpenAI using structured output.

The problem is that the visual editor where I can add the examples doesn’t seem to support structured outputs.

Has anyone else run into this? Do you know how I can fix it?

Hey [/u/guillermogaete](@GuillermoGaete) to clarify -


You have a dataset in LangSmith with a dataset schema
You have examples in your dataset that don’t support that schema, however you want them in your dataset?
