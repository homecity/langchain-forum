I want to know whether Langmem supports storage of meta data or not?

when creating the memory i also want to store some meta data along with the extracted data.

Also one more thing,

i do saw that expired at column in store but its null every-time how can i populate this and what is its use? does langmem has auto deletion of memories after the expiry time
