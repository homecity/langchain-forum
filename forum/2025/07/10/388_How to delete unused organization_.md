I created an org, but want to delete it because I won’t be using it.

For example, I created an org name “XYZ” personally—but my company’s admin also created “XYZ” and invited me to that org.  Is there a way to remove the “XYZ” that I created personally?

Hi [/u/sicktastic](@sicktastic),

We don’t have a self-service option available today to delete empty organizations, but if you submit a ticket with our support team we can process it for you. [https://support.langchain.com/](https://support.langchain.com/)

Thank you,

Chad
