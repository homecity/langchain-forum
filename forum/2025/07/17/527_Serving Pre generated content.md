I have usecase to serve stream content and non-stream content from a single graph..  react agent 1 (non-stream) and react agent 2 (stream) connected to supervisor agent.   graph executes with streamEvents which is primarily for streaming.

How do i send pre generated content (json ) in the non-stream mode.  backend is nodejs and front end is reactjs

would be helpful if any suggestions
