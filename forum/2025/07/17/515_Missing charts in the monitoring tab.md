I’ve noticed that some charts are missing in the Monitoring tab for some deployments.

In one the` Redis` section is not showing anything - this is the case for at least a day, that’s when I noticed it, it might be like that always, I haven’t checked before

Another deployment is missing the `Postgres` section:

Hi [/u/lukanarrative](@lukanarrative), thanks for flagging this. I will look into this on our side - are you still seeing these issues even now?
