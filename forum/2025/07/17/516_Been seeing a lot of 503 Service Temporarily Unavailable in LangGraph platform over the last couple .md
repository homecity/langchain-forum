Has there been maintenance happening or something?  I am concerned this will happen in our production environment and users will get a bad experience.

Any info on this would be great.

Thanks,

Michael

No maintenance happening. This would typically happen if your deployment doesn’t start successfully.

What’s your deployment ID?

Do you mean the URL in the langsmith UI?

URL also works.

I mean the “ID” shown next to your deployment name.
