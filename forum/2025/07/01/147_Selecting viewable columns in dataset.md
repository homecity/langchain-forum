Would be great if we could select which columns to see in the dataset viewer. It’s great that it’s possible to do that for traces, can you please add that to the examples table as well?

This is overwhelming, and we can’t select only the columns we care about:

Thanks!

Looks like a similar feature was just launched for [https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/analyze_single_experiment#customizing-columns](experiments).
