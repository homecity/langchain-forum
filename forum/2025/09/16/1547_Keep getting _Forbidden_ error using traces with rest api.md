Hi there

We are on a paid plan on LangSmith and trying to setup tracing through the Rest Api. I created the api key and use it to call the runs endpoint in order to start a trace as indicated in the documentation [https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trace-with-api](here)

I keep getting an error saying “Forbidden” and nothing more, which isnt really helpful. I saw that if my api key is not correct or missing am getting an “Unauthorised” error, so i guess this might be something with permissions or other project settings?"

Any help would be appreciated, some more details in the screenshots below.
