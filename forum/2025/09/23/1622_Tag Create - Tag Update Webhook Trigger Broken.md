Hello!

I’m attempting to setup an intermediary service that will receive webhook triggers on Prompt Commit tag’s being updated or created. A key feature of this is being able to read the tag for the commit. The payload for the Commit webhook trigger doesn’t contain this information. The Tag Create/Update webhook claims to work succesfully but I’m only able to receive a payload form the Commit webhook. Any insight into what’s going on here? I’ve seen the issue in other posts, but it seems unaddressed. Let me know what the latest is on this.

Brandon
