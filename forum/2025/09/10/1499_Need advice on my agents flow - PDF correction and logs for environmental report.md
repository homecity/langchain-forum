Hello everybody,

I’m looking for advice to correct environmental PDF automatically with langchain/graph. If you have any recommendation, or if I’m totally off, please don’t hesitate! or source/cookbooks for help.

More details:


Goal of this is to automatically correct what is wrong in the pdf, based on the documentation in the vector database
Vector database is from around 50 PDF with laws about environment that contractors need to respect
INPUT is PDF is a report after a job. OUTPUT the corrected PDF, and a PDF listing everything that changes with the citations and the source
each rectangular object here is an agent
I’m not sure how the agent will work yet

Here is the flowchart, any questions let me know!
