We can’t load any projects on langsmith. Langsmith has been very slow for us recently.

Hi. I’m sorry for the degraded experience you are seeing.

Unfortunatelt, we are dealing with a complex production outage stemming from one of our vendors and is causing widespread degradation in the app.

We will keep the status page up to date at [http://status.smith.langchain.com](status.smith.langchain.com)

Thanks,

Ankush
