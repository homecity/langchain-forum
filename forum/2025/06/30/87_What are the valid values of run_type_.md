From the document, I see examples using “llm, chain, retriever”. Is there a place that I can find all valid values? Thanks!

`"tool", "chain", "llm", "retriever", "embedding", "prompt", "parser"`

This is the full list of run types - this isn’t exposed well in any of our docs afaict, thanks for flagging!
