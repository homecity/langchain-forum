Hi there, I have alerts setup (webhook via slack) and it works if I test it (via the send test notification) but it doens’t work when there’s a real alert! The real alerts trigger on the page but the webhook doesn’t get fired.

Can anyone help?

Could you send us your workspace id and the project id these alerts are set on? also how was the alert set up?

Are those safe to share here? Or should I send them over email? If so can you send me an email

Just wanted to follow-up that it’s been almost 20 days since I posted this and I still haven’t gotten this resolved.

The last message with support was over 7 days aggo (waiting for them to respond).

It has been a very frustrating process.
