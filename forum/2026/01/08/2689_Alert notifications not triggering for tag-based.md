[#p-5339-slack-notifications-not-triggering-for-tag-based-rules-despite-threshold-met-1]()**Slack notifications not triggering for Tag-based Rules despite threshold met**
**Description:** I am trying to set up an alert in LangSmith using tags to filter specific runs.

**The Issue:** Even though the rule seems to be configured correctly, I am not receiving any notifications in Slack.

**Observations:**


The filters are working: I can see the correct runs being selected in the dashboard.
The threshold is met: The metrics clearly cross the defined limit.
The Slack integration is enabled (other alerts/tests work).

Has anyone experienced issues with tag-based filters preventing the webhook from firing, how do i fix it? Please help
