**About the role**

We’re hiring a **Senior Technical Support Engineer** to lead our customer support experience for highly technical users, from AI engineers to infrastructure architects. You’ll be on the front lines helping teams debug production LLM applications and agents, improve AI observability and evaluations, and unblock critical issues. You’ll also help define what world-class technical support looks like for modern AI platforms

## **Key Responsibilities**

  * Be the **go-to escalation point** for technical support inquiries—diagnosing issues across customer setup, LangChain products, and deployment issues.

  * Work directly with **engineering, operations, documentation, and product teams** to resolve bugs, suggest patches, and advocate for customer needs.

  * Partner with Deployed Engineering to support critical enterprise customers.

  * Build and refine internal tooling, diagnostics, and **runbooks for complex issue triage**.

  * Lead post-mortems for critical incidents and feed learnings back into product and documentation.

  * Help refine KPIs for support health (MTTR, CSAT, bug recurrence) and drive continuous improvement.

  * Improve documentation and knowledge articles to improve 1-to-many resources and provide proactive support.

  * Mentor and coach other support engineers.

**How to be successful in this role**

  * 4+ years in technical support, solutions engineering, or SRE roles in **deeply technical B2B environments** (e.g., observability, infrastructure, data platforms).

  * Expert troubleshooting skills across **APIs, SDKs, distributed systems, and cloud-native stacks**.

  * Programming experience with **Python.** Bonus if you have **TypeScript** experience.

  * Hands-on knowledge of **Kubernetes and Docker**

  * Comfort working with **logs, traces, metrics** in Datadog, and 3rd-party integrations (e.g., OpenTelemetry, LLM providers).

  * Experience supporting enterprise customers and collaborating with engineering on complex escalations.

  * A bias for clarity and continuous improvement: you write succinct, helpful, and accurate responses and build a foundation for case deflection.

  * High ownership — want to do what’s best for the customer and the company and are relentlessly results oriented

**Compensation & Benefits**

  * Competitive salary and equity stake for role and stage of company. Commensurate with experience.

  * Annual salary range: $130,000 - $170,000 USD
