[Studio](/langsmith/studio) in the [LangSmith Deployment UI](https://smith.langchain.com) supports connecting to two types of graphs:

-   Graphs deployed on [cloud or self-hosted](#deployed-graphs).
-   Graphs running locally with [Agent Server](#local-development-server).

##

Deployed graphs

Studio is accessed in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com) from the **Deployments** navigation. For applications that are [deployed](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart), you can access Studio as part of that deployment. To do so, navigate to the deployment in the UI and select **Studio**. This will load Studio connected to your live deployment, allowing you to create, read, and update the [threads](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads), [assistants](/langsmith/assistants), and [memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory) in that deployment.

Prerequisites

To test your application locally using Studio:

-   Follow the [local application quickstart](/langsmith/local-server) first.
-   If you don’t want data [traced](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces) to LangSmith, set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=false` in your application’s `.env` file. With tracing disabled, no data leaves your local server.

###

](#setup)

Setup

1.  Install the [LangGraph CLI](/langsmith/cli):
    
    pip
    
    uv
    
    npm
    
    Copy
    
    ```
    pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
    langgraph dev
    ```
    
    **Browser Compatibility** Safari blocks `localhost` connections to Studio. To work around this, run the command with `--tunnel` to access Studio via a secure tunnel. You’ll need to manually add the tunnel URL to allowed origins by clicking **Connect to a local server** in the Studio UI. See the [troubleshooting guide](/langsmith/troubleshooting-studio#safari-connection-issues) for steps.
    
    This will start the Agent Server locally, running in-memory. The server will run in watch mode, listening for and automatically restarting on code changes. Read this [reference](/langsmith/cli#dev) to learn about all the options for starting the API server. You will see the following logs:
    
    Copy
    
    ```
    > Ready!
    >
    > - API: [http://localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024/)
    >
    > - Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs
    >
    > - LangSmith Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
    ```
    
    Once running, you will automatically be directed to Studio.
2.  For a running server, access the Dbugger with one of the following:
    
    1.  Directly navigate to the following URL: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.
    2.  Navigate to **Deployments** in the UI, click the **Studio** button on a deployment, enter `http://127.0.0.1:2024` and click **Connect**.
    
    If running your server at a different host or port, update the `baseUrl` to match.

(Optional) Attach a debugger

For step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection, run the following:

pip

uv

Copy

```
# Install debugpy package
pip install debugpy
# Start server with debugging enabled
langgraph dev --debug-port 5678
```

Then attach your preferred debugger:

-   VS Code
    
-   PyCharm
    

Add this configuration to `launch.json`:

Copy

```
{
    "name": "Attach to LangGraph",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "attach",
    "connect": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 5678
    }
}
```

1.  Go to Run → Edit Configurations
2.  Click + and select “Python Debug Server”
3.  Set IDE host name: `localhost`
4.  Set port: `5678` (or the port number you chose in the previous step)
5.  Click “OK” and start debugging

For issues getting started, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](/langsmith/troubleshooting-studio).
