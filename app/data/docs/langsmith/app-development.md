**LangSmith Deployment** builds on the open-source [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) framework for developing stateful, multi-agent applications. LangGraph provides the core abstractions and execution model, while LangSmith adds managed infrastructure, observability, deployment options, assistants, and concurrency controls—supporting the full lifecycle from development to production.

LangSmith Deployment is framework-agnostic: you can deploy agents built with LangGraph or [other frameworks](/langsmith/deploy-other-frameworks). To get started with LangGraph itself, refer to the [LangGraph quickstart](/oss/python/langgraph/quickstart).
