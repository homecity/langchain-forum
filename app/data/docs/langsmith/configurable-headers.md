LangGraph allows runtime configuration to modify agent behavior and permissions dynamically. When using [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart), you can pass this configuration in the request body (`config`) or specific request headers. This enables adjustments based on user identity or other requests. For privacy, control which headers are passed to the runtime configuration via the `http.configurable_headers` section in your [`langgraph.json`](/langsmith/application-structure#configuration-file) file. Here’s how to customize the included and excluded headers:

Copy

```
{
  "http": {
    "configurable_headers": {
      "includes": ["x-user-id", "x-organization-id", "my-prefix-*"],
      "excludes": ["authorization", "x-api-key"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `includes` and `excludes` lists accept exact header names or patterns using `*` to match any number of characters. For your security, no other regex patterns are supported.

](#using-within-your-graph)

Using within your graph

You can access the included headers in your graph using the `config` argument of any node.

Copy

```
def my_node(state, config):
  organization_id = config["configurable"].get("x-organization-id")
  ...
```

Or by fetching from context (useful in tools and or within other nested functions).

Copy

```
from langgraph.config import get_config

def search_everything(query: str):
  organization_id = get_config()["configurable"].get("x-organization-id")
  ...
```

You can even use this to dynamically compile the graph.

Copy

```
# my_graph.py.
import contextlib

@contextlib.asynccontextmanager
async def generate_agent(config):
  organization_id = config["configurable"].get("x-organization-id")
  if organization_id == "org1":
    graph = ...
    yield graph
  else:
    graph = ...
    yield graph

```

Copy

```
{
  "graphs": {"agent": "my_grph.py:generate_agent"}
}
```

### 

[​

](#opt-out-of-configurable-headers)

Opt-out of configurable headers

If you’d like to opt-out of configurable headers, you can simply set a wildcard pattern in the `s` list:

Copy

```
{
  "http": {
    "configurable_headers": {
      "excludes": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This will exclude all headers from being added to your run’s configuration. Note that exclusions take precedence over inclusions.
